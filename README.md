# StyleGAN-ADA
This project presents an investigation into the potential of the latent space of
StyleGAN2-ADA, a state-of-the-art data-efficient Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), for developing novel techniques for image editing. Our analysis
revealed the existence of non-linear paths in the latent space that can be exploited
for conditional attribute editing. Specifically, we found that manipulating certain
attributes in the latent space can lead to significant changes in the generated image, such as altering the color of an object or adding or removing features.
